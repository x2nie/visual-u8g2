nokia-xxx.bdf fonts are taken from https://github.com/pjanx/nokia-3310-fonts
their readme:

	These are the fonts used on the Nokia 3310 phone.  I've reconstructed them by
	hand, by looking at the screen and drawing the characters as I see them into
	GIMP, and then done some processing to make this actually useful.

	nokia-fonts.png is the original image I've drawn with some colour-coded
	information you shouldn't need to care about.

	Accented characters not included.  Some of them are over here, should you wish
	to add them yourself: http://www.dafont.com/nokia-cellphone.font

	Use nokia-fonts.c, as the textual representation doesn't specify the real
	horizontal advance for the characters (some of them don't have a 1px space to
	the right of them).  I've fixed this manually.

	I've found this useful in VIM to highlight the zeros:
		:highlight mygroup ctermbg=red
		:match mygroup /0/

	There are also some BDF files provided, so that you can e.g. create a TTF file
	by converting them using fontforge and happily use the fonts wherever you like.

	I've compiled two example TTF files for your convenience.
